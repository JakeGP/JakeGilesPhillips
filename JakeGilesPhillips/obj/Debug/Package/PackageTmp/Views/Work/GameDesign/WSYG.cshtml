            Since September 2015, as part of a University assignment, I have been working in a group to create a game with the intention of assisting post-stroke patients to regain movement in affected limbs. The problem these patients faced was that many rehabilitation exercises and programs were often expensive and unnecessary, when studies already conducted have shown much cheaper and more enjoyable methods of video game rehabilitation to provide the same if not better results.
            <br/>
            We had a range of choices for this assignment, and we decided as a team to focus our game on the mobile market, looking at a product that would assist patients in regaining hand and finger movement lost as a result of stroke. The game was designed to be fast paced and provide the player with a range of many different mini-games, that tested their finger movements in a wide variety of ways.
