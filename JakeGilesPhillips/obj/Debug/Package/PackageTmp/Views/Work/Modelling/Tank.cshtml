            The Tank above, is something I created for a 3D modelling assignment during my first year, the brief was to create both a low and high poly model of a war vehicle within the time period 1959 - 1979. 
            <br/>
            I chose the FV4101 Charioteer Tank for my model, as I felt like this was a good place to start for my first model. It is both blocky and simple in areas, yet curved and intricate in others, allowing me to learn at a smooth pace, working on both large basic areas, before delving into small detailed areas.
            <br />
            <br />
            After creating the high and low poly models, we were instructed to use normal mapping and lightmapping techniques to texture the low poly in order to make it look aesthetically detailed.
