            This map was the outcome of my first Unreal Engine assignment at university. We were tasked with creating an First Person Shooter level, but the theme and design was completely up to us.

            I tried to design something that looks Victorian and slightly dated by todays architecture, yet futuristic in its own rights. The rustic looking city of New Berlin is floating high up in the sky, and the small town you see on the left is only a part of many other floating clusters.
            The inspiration for this level came from games like Bioshock Infinite and Fallout, where they too explore themes of post war, futuristic settings, styled in unique, steampunk dressings.

            I created a lot of the buildings within the engine itself, using the bsp volumes available before converting them to static meshes, and I resourced several models and textures to help spice up the finishing aesthetics.

            Overall I was very pleased with this assignment, commended by my lecturers and selected as one of the top five in my year, I presented it to the rest of the course and received good marks.
            It helped me to expand upon my knowledge of Unreal Engine, and its capabilities. Things I worked on in this level that weren't included in our assignment brief were Blueprints, where I created climbable ladders, bobbing hot air balloons and opening doors complete with sound effects.
