            Flow Rider was a collaberative game created for the 2017 global games jam. <br />
            The theme for this years jam was <b>Waves</b>, and me and my partner decided to do something different. <br />
            Rather than focusing on the obvious connotation of waves, we came up with the idea of using sound waves, and created a game that is dynamically generated using music.<br />
            The game is of two player split screen style, and the objective is to keep your character as close to the center of the soundwave as possible. The motion of the soundwave is dynamically 
            generated from a users selected song by analysing the high and mid frequencies of the track, and the point rings are spawned using the low frequencies. Not only does this make every play
            unique, the difficulty of the track is directly related to the intesity of the song. In much the same way that songs in Guitar Hero get harder the more intense the song is, the waveform and rings spawned
            in this game become faster and more intense depending on the intensity of the song. <br /><br />
